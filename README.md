1. As a marketeer, I want to prevent users from seeing the same image in two subsequent iterations, so that they are not biased.

   - Update your algorithm to randomly generate three unique product images from the images directory.

   - Update your algorithm so that new products are generated, confirm that these products are not duplicates from the immediate previous set.

2. As a marketing manager, I would like a visual representation of how many times a product was clicked so that I can visually analyze the results.

   - Using ChartJS (imported from CDN), display the vote totals and the number of times a product was viewed in a bar chart format. (hint: donâ€™t forget about the **_canvas_** tags
   - Place the bar chart in the section located beneath your three product images
   - The bar charts should only appear after all voting data has been collected.
